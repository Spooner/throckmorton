Game of Scones (working title)
------------------------------

Description
-----------

Prototype dual-stick dungeon-crawl shooter (simple 1-player gauntlet clone at the moment)

Currently, the favourite possible final name for the game is "Froglodytes" (Where the players are shamans for a race of
primitive, underground, froggish people).
