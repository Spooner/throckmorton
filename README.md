primitive, underground, froggish people).

Controls
--------

* Hold tab: Map (also pauses in SP).

Enemies
-------

Enemy names are arbitrary and subject to changes based on final setting.

* Goblin archers - small, weak, try to stay at range and shoot arrows
* Orcs - medium strength
* Ogres - high damage and health, but slow
* Ticks - tiny, weak, but very fast-moving
